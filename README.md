## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a Mathematics student at Udayana University with a deep interest in **data science, data analysis, and machine learning engineering**. I am actively expanding my knowledge and looking for opportunities to participate in projects where I can apply my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, I am enhancing my expertise in machine learning, large-scale data processing, and data management to contribute to more effective business decision-making.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, R, 
- **Tools & Platforms:** Jupyter Notebook, R

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Currently Learning
I'm always eager to expand my knowledge! Currently, I'm exploring:
- ðŸ“Š **Advanced Data Analysis & Visualization**
- ðŸ¤– **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**

## ðŸ›  My Latest Project
 **1. Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning Algorithms** - 

- **Description:**  
 This project focuses on classifying breast cancer using machine learning algorithms, specifically **Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and Naive Bayes**. It applies these models to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on given features, evaluating their performance to determine the most effective approach.

- **Technologies Used:**  
  - Python  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  

- **Features:**  
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
  - Model selection and evaluation (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
  - Performance comparison of different ML models  
  - Visualization of key insights and model results
